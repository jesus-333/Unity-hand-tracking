# Unity-Python hand tracking and gesture recognition application
In this repository I uploaded a personal project that use a combination of python script and C# script to create a Unity application with hand tracking and gesture recognition.
I use a python script to detect the hand movement and the relative gesture.

A simple video demo is aviable at this [link(1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4Udf7Gu3zE). I also made another video demo with a far mored advance hand tracking method that use always the same technique to link Python and Unity. You could find the video at this [link(2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nmR-dRdeos).

For the code for the advance hand tracking see my other project called Hand Tracking Pytorch. You could find the repository on my profile or following this [link](https://github.com/jesus-333/Hand-Tracking-Pytorch).

I upload a pdf report that describ in all details how the code and the unity integration work.
